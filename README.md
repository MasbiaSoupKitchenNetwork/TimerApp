# Timer App

This terminal app used to help the folks at the Masbia Soup Kitchen Network assess the efficiency of the process they use to service their clients.

Once the program is installed, it will create files in the same folder the program is run from. Data is saved after every timed event, so no reason to stress if you accidentally close the program.

## Installation
Download <code>timed_event.py</code> and <code>menu.py</code> to the folder you would like to store both your data and the program in.

## Use
Use your favorate terminal program to navigate into the directory where you have downloaded <code>timed_event.py</code> and <code>menu.py</code> and run <code>python timed_event.py</code>. Once you select an event to time from the menu, you will begin timing. To stop the timer, hit spacebar. The event will save and the program will print to the screen all the start and end times and elasped times that have been recorded for that event. Hitting any key will bring you back to the menu and you may begin timing the next event.

## Troubleshooting
This program is written in Python 3. If you have only Python 2, as is still default on macs, you'll need to download and run the program with Python 3.
